# dojo-intro-to-machine-learning

In this dojo, we will explore classical machine learning methods for classification and prediction.  
`classification.py` and `regression.py` have boilerplace code prepared. `data` contains 
a number of datasets to be used while trying out the models.  
It is recommended to pick 1-2 machine learning methods, read up on them, and then 
try to tune and play with them.

## dependencies

- pandas: dataframe manipulation
- sklearn: classic machine learning methods
- keras: easy high level API for neural networks
- xgboost: special extreme gradient boost library
